DocHub's Purpose
================

LSST produces a vast number of artifacts on a continual basis.
Software and associated documentation repositories are published through GitHub.
Documents and presentations may also be archived in DocuShare, but also on Zenodo to enable scientific citation.
Conversations about tasks may happen in JIRA, while more general conversations happen on the Community.lsst.org forum.
Papers may be written on GitHub, but are ultimately made available through ADS and a publisher's website.
Ultimately, finding information is more difficult than it should be.

One response is to pare down the number of places where LSST's information artifacts can exist.
While laudable --- and using platforms with identical use cases and feature sets simultaneously is certainly confusing --- retreating to a single platform is not a solution.
Each platform facilitates different types of work.
Arbitrarily forcing work onto platforms that aren't a good fit for that work reduces productivity.

Instead, our approach is to decouple information discovery from the platforms that information exists on.
We will index LSST information artifacts, and make their metadata centrally available through a website and search API.
Then, finding LSST information involves searching through a single website rather than iteratively trawing individual platforms.
This system for indexing LSST information artifacts, storing metadata in a database, and making metadata available through an API and website is called *DocHub*.
This technote describes LSST DocHub's design.

DocHub Architecture
===================

Existing Metadata systems
-------------------------

Information discovery is common issue across large, distributed organizations like LSST.
These are some implementations of DocHub-like systems by other open software and data organizations:

- 18F embeds `.about.yml <https://github.com/18F/about_yml>`__ metadata files in their repositories. These are indexed and published on 18F's `Dashboard <https://18f.gsa.gov/dashboard>`__.
- Code for America has `civic.json <https://github.com/codeforamerica/brigade/blob/master/README-Project-Search.md>`__. These are used by Code for America's `project search page <https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/projects>`__. Primarily it is used to denote the status of a project and to provide tags for search. It seems that a lot of information for the search page is also automatically obtained from GitHub metadata, like the project description.
- Code.gov embeds a `code.json <https://code.gov/#/policy-guide/docs/compliance/inventory-code>`__ file in federal repositories. This metadata is tracked and published by the Code.gov website and API. Additional discussion about code.gov's metadata schema is taking place on `a GitHub issue <https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-web/issues/41>`__. Earlier discussion also happened on a White House `source-code-policy <https://github.com/WhiteHouse/source-code-policy/issues/117>` issue.
- `CodeMeta <https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta>`__ is minimal metadata schema, written in JSON-LD, that can describe scientific software repositories. CodeMeta's schema is designed to be cross-walked to other 
- `Asset description metadata for software <https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/adms_foss/home>`__ from the EU. See `Issue #41 at codemeta <https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/issues/41>`__ as well.
- `BibJSON <http://okfnlabs.org/bibjson/>`__ describes resources with JSON objects with fields defined in BibTeX. Being JSON, it's also possible to describe these files with JSON-LD.

These metadata systems share a common pattern: metadata is embedded with the information artifact, centrally indexed, and made available through a search API and website.
This approach scales well since it federates metadata definition and maintenance to the source repositories themselves.
DocHub builds upon this design pattern.

JSON-LD Metadata
================

JSON-LD Resources
-----------------

- `JSON-LD best practices <http://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld-api-best-practices/>`__.
- `Buidling a better book in the browser <http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/10668>`__
- `Linked Data Patterns <http://patterns.dataincubator.org/book/index.html>`__
- `Indexing bibliographic linked data with JSON-LD, ElasticSearch <http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/7949>`__.
- `JSON-LD: Building meaningful data APIs <http://blog.codeship.com/json-ld-building-meaningful-data-apis/>`__.
