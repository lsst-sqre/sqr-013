   This technote is a work in progress.

   The purpose of this document is to document research and design towards a metadata system that can be used to annotate and index all LSST code and documentation repositories.
   Such metadata would be consumed by the LSST DocHub search service, and be used by Zenodo, ADS, and other web services.
